# Fixing Dependency Conflicts

This document provides solutions for resolving the dependency conflict between `date-fns` and `react-day-picker` packages.

## The Issue

The build failure is due to a dependency resolution issue caused by conflicting versions of the `date-fns` package required by the `react-day-picker` package. The `react-day-picker@8.10.1` requires `date-fns` version `^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0`.

## Solution 1: Update package.json

The `package.json` file has been updated to include:

1. A specific version of `date-fns` that's compatible with `react-day-picker`:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "date-fns": "^2.30.0",
     "react-day-picker": "^8.10.1"
   }
